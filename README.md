# Java Synchronization

When multiple threads access shared resources, it can lead to synchronization issues. Letâ€™s explore the need for synchronization, the issues that arise without it, and the solutions available in Java.

# What is the issue if we don't use synchronization?

Let's look at the below example , where a share resource is used by multiple threads.
ShareResource : This is the object shared among two threads.
Adder : Adder thread increment the share variable 100 times.
Subtractor : Subtractor thread decrement the shared variable 100 times.
Expected Result : The value of the shared variable should be 0.
Actual result : The value is non zero.

package multithreading;
public class Adder extends Thread{
	SharedResorce sharedResorce;
	public Adder(SharedResorce sharedResorce) {
		this.sharedResorce = sharedResorce;
	}
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("--------- Adder started ----------");
		for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
			sharedResorce.increment();
		}
		System.out.println("--------- Adder Completed ----------");
	}
}

package multithreading;
public class Subtractor extends Thread {
	SharedResorce sharedResorce;
	public Subtractor(SharedResorce sharedResorce) {
		this.sharedResorce = sharedResorce;
	}
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("--------- Subtractor started ----------");
		for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
			sharedResorce.decrement();
		}
		System.out.println("--------- Subtractor Completed ----------");
	}
}

package multithreading;

public class SharedResorce {
	private int count = 0;

	public SharedResorce(int count) {
		this.count = count;
	}

	public void  increment() {
		try {
			Thread.sleep(10);
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		count++;
	}

	public void decrement() {
		try {
			Thread.sleep(10);
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		count--;
	}

	public int getCount() {
		return count;
	}
}

package multithreading;

public class Runner {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SharedResorce sharedResource = new SharedResorce(0);
		Thread adder = new Adder(sharedResource);
		Thread subtractor = new Subtractor(sharedResource);

		/*
		 * When we try to use multiple threads on a share object , if the shared
		 * resource is not synchronized it can cause inconsistent results.
		 * 
		 * Adder thread increments the shared variable 100 times , and Subtractor thread
		 * decrements the value 100 times.
		 * 
		 * Intentionally , the threads are sleeping for 10 ms , to ensure another both
		 * of these threads gets the chance to execute the shared variable
		 * 
		 */

		adder.start();
		subtractor.start();
		try {
			adder.join();
			subtractor.join();
		} catch (Exception e) {
			// TODO: handle exception
		}
		// The correct value of the output should be 0 , but it's non 0
		System.out.println(sharedResource.getCount());
  }
}
